## Eye-Disease-Detection
Eye Disease Detection using Machine Learning This project implements a deep learning model for the automated detection and classification of common eye diseases from retinal fundus images.

# Overview
This project is a deep learning-based classification model for detecting and categorizing eye diseases. It classifies images into four categories:

# Normal
Cataract
Diabetic Retinopathy
Glaucoma
Features
Image Preprocessing: Augmentation, normalization, and resizing for better model performance.
Deep Learning Model: Uses TensorFlow/Keras for training and evaluation.
Dataset Handling: Supports custom datasets for training and testing.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the script:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python pandas seaborn


# Expected Output

Model training accuracy and loss graphs.
Predictions on test images with classification labels.
